# Machine-Learnig
My first steps in Machine Learnig. I have written ML scripts which use different ML methodes such as: Linear Regression, Classification, Clustering and more.
The idea behind this repository is to give information about the most popular ML models and their usage. The code in the files is not very complicated but it shows the idea of every ML model which I have coded. I hope it is useful for you!
